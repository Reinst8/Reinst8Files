Usage Guidelines
================

**Please do**:

* Make it clear that the resources are from the Reinst8 movement. 
  Where possible, a link to or mention of the official site (http://reinst8.org.uk/) is the best way to do this.
* Use the high-quality, [provided vectors](https://github.com/Reinstate/Reinst8Files/tree/master/logo) to present
  the assets at their best.
* Ensure there is ample padding around the assets.

**Please don't**:

* Use the provided assets in a way that implies endorsement or affiliation.
* Modify the assets (excluding resizing while maintaining aspect ratio) in any way.
  * This includes (but is not limited to) cropping, recolouring, stretching, superimposing, rotating.
* Use the assets in a context completely unrelated to the goals of the movement.
